# .win

This device provides a method for creating and manipulating windows for AQUA programs.
This implementation does this through [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).

## Note on X11 support

If you need to use X11, use `aquabsd.alps.win`.
The current implementation only supports Wayland.
X11 support may come back in the future, but no promises ;)
